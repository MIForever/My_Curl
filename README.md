# Welcome to My Curl
***

## Task
The task is to create an implementation of the curl command in Linux.

## Description
my_curl is actually as simple program that prints out html content of a website.
There is a bug that server is not responding as much as we requested in read function in the half of the loop, 
even though there is a rest of the content and in the next loop it is responding as we requested (which is 1024 bytes).

## Installation
There is a Makefile created to make things easier. You just simply "make" it after downloading or pulling.

## Usage
After creating the target you type "my_curl" to command prompt.
After that you type a web pages link which you want to get.
Subsequently, the full html content of the page will show up.
```
./my_curl <URL>
```
